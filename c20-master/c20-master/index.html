      <div class="item"><h2> Camel properties</h2>
    <p> Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. 
        There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps.
         Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce</p>

         <div class="item"><h2> Chameleon properties</h2>
         <p> Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; 
             their very extensive, not highly modified, rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout. 
             Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail.</p>

             <div class="item"><h2> Pigeon properties </h2>
             <p> Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a skin saddle (cere) between the bill and forehead. 
                 All pigeons strut about with a characteristic bobbing of the head. 
                 Because of their long wings and powerful flight muscles, they are strong, swift fliers.</p>

                 <div class="item"><h2> Bear properties</h2>
                 <p>Bears are not mean or malicious; they are very gentle and tolerant animals.
                    Mother bears are affectionate, protective, devoted, strict, sensitive and attentive with their young. 
                    Not unlike people, bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful, social and even altruistic.</p>

                    <div class="item"> <h2> Panda properties </h2>
                    <p> Giant pandas have a distinctive appearance. 
                        Their thick black and white fur equips them for life in cool forests. 
                        Their white coat with black markings is unique, with black patches round the eyes and ears, black legs, and a black band around the shoulders. 
                        And they have cute white tails.</p>

                        <div class="item"><h2> Flying-cicada </h2>
                        <p>Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. 
                            They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals.</p>
